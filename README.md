# Quantum Chemistry Methods with Python

This repository is a collection of projects that provide an introduction to quantum chemistry methods with Python. The implementations are not intended to be the most efficient or optimized, but rather to focus on understanding the quantum chemical methods.

The projects are heavily influenced by [CrawfordGroup's](https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects) ProgrammingProjects and [Psi4Numpy](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy) repositories.

Each project is organized in its own directory, containing a notebook file with instructions and implementation details. Some projects require input files, which are discussed in the notebooks and can be found in the inputs directory. The inputs directory contains subdirectories for several different molecule/basis-set combinations, each of which includes integrals, molecular geometries, and other relevant files for use as input to your programs.

This repository is intended to provide a resource for learning quantum chemistry methods with Python, and the projects are designed to be accessible to learners with a basic understanding of programming and quantum chemistry.
